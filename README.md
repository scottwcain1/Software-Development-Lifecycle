# Software-Development-Lifecycle


The SNHU Travel project had our team start with a waterfall approach and then transition to the Scrum-Agile method. Using Agile allowed us to make a better product while being more adaptable for task completion, we could more quickly handle issues and find a resolution through continuous testing. As a Scrum-Agile team, we were able to adapt user stories, handle interruptions, enhance communication, and utilize organizational tools that we did not have before.
Each Scrum-Agile team role played its part in the project's success. The Product Owner maintained clear communication with stakeholders and the team, keeping the project in line with stakeholder criteria. With the shift in focus to detox and wellness travel, the product owner was quick to communicate the change, allowing the team to adjust priorities and tasks within the original timeframe.
The developer then had to assess the current project’s features and provide feedback on what goals were realistic within the remaining timeframe. This helped the project owner re-prioritize tasks and focus on the most critical features or tasks. The tester updated his test cases to align with the new focus on detox and wellness travel. This flexibility lets the team have the flexibility to add new features to meet stakeholder goals without compromising quality.
The Scrum Master organized meetings and made use of Scrum practices that the waterfall didn’t allow before. By helping the team stay on track and stepping in where needed to help the team finish the project in the original timeframe. The Scrum-Agile approach was very helpful by breaking all tasks into smaller, manageable tasks, allowing continuous feedback and that would ensure fewer mistakes in the final project. 
The greatest strength of using the Scrum-Agile approach was its adaptability. When SNHU Travel shifted focus to wellness travel, our team quickly re-prioritized the backlog and adjusted sprint goals. This flexibility allowed us to meet client needs while staying within the project’s timeframe. Increased communication facilitated quicker task completion, and regular sprint reviews ensured team alignment.
Interpreting users’ needs and understanding of their requirements and expectations, then turning those into clear user stories to test. User stories help break down tasks into smaller more manageable tasks.  This will help the team to focus on the features with user needs. This approach maintains focus while the product evolves based on direct user feedback.
Developing programs with the Agile method emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement and testing. Key Agile processes include iterative development, regular sprint reviews, and retrospectives. These practices allow for constant feedback and adjustments, ensuring the final product meets user expectations. For instance, regular sprint reviews enable the team to demonstrate progress to stakeholders and receive immediate feedback allowing quick pivots or enhancements.
Being a good team member in software development means collaboration, open communication, and helping or supporting your peers. Being involved in team meetings, offering constructive feedback, and being adaptable to different roles as needed. A good team member contributes to a positive, productive working environment and is committed to the team's collective success.
